The .json acts as the widgets schema/settings that is fed to the widget as props and stored in Firebase for the specific configuration. To process payments and refunds, offer shipping labels, email/sms marketing, and manage customers/carts we utilized Lightspeed POS. The code cannot be publicly shared sadly at the clients request.',
